# cpp-ctb-replays
**Completely not ready but you can use it if you want**

SFML is already in the project so its technically ready to use.

<br>

**Smol use instuctions:**

- Set the player count in **settings.json**
- Put the amount of replays set in **settings.json** into **cpp-ctb-replays/cpp-ctb-replays/rawrpdata/replay/**
- Name the replays with numbers (From 0.osr to **((PLAYER NUMBER SET IN SETTINGS.JSON) - 1).osr**)
- Set **parseReplays** to **true** if running the replays for the first time

- **Done!**

Compile **main.cpp** in **Visual Studio 2019** and be happy! (no)

***Note:*** *You can also use the release, but it only supports 3 players and has no parser or documentation. I won't be upload the 50 players version with a parser, because its stupid and most likely be broken if I try to.*
